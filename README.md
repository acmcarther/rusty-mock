# Rust_Stub

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acmcarther/rust_stub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acmcarther/rust_stub)

Rust_Stub provides some super quick macros for mocking out an implementor for your Trait. If you follow the practice of building traits for your application boundaries this lets you test them in isolation. The macro & interface is super raw, so please take care.

## Example
Example is gone for now, please check out the integration test for some examples.
